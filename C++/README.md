## Introduction

This C++ program calculates the distance between two points in 3D space. It provides two distance metrics: Euclidean and Manhattan. You can choose the method for calculating the distance and enter the coordinates of the two points to get the result.

## Features

- Calculates Euclidean and Manhattan distances between two 3D points.
- User-friendly command-line interface.
- Input validation to ensure valid numeric input.
- Error handling for invalid inputs or methods.

## Usage

To run this program, you need a C++ compiler installed on your system. If you don't already have one, you can typically install it on MacOS using the following command:

```shell
brew install gcc
```

On Windows, you can use [MinGW](https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/) or install a C++ development environment like [Code::Blocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/) or [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/).

Once you have a C++ compiler installed, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/Tooth-Fox11/minecraft-distance-calculators-in-different-languages.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```shell
    cd minecraft-distance-calculators-in-different-languages/C++
    ```

3. Compile the C++ code using your C++ compiler:

    ```shell
    g++ main.cpp -o main
    ```

4. Run the program:

    ```shell
    ./main
    ```

Please ensure that you have a C++ compiler installed and configured on your system before proceeding with the installation and usage of this program.
