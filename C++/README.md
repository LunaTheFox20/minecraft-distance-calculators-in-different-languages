### How to run this?

Well I'm glad you asked. To run this code, you have to follow these steps:

### 1. Download a C++ compiler
Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system. Common compilers include [GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)](https://gcc.gnu.org/) for Linux, [MinGW](https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/) for Windows, or [Xcode Command Line Tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/resources/) for macOS.

### 2. Open a Text Editor
Use a text editor of your choice (e.g., [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), [Vim](https://www.vim.org), or anything you prefer) to create a new text file.

### 3. Copy and Paste the Code
Copy the C++ code found in [here](https://github.com/Tooth-Fox11/minecraft-distance-calculators-in-different-languages/blob/main/C%2B%2B/main.cpp) and paste it into the text file.

### 4. Save the File
Save the file with a ".cpp" extension. You can choose any name for the file, but make sure it has the ".cpp" extension. For example, you can name it "distance_calculator.cpp."

### 5. Compile the Code
Now here comes the fun part. 
Open your system's command prompt or terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved the ".cpp" file, and compile the code using the C++ compiler.
The exact compilation command depends on your compiler, but a common command for GCC is:

```
bash
g++ -o distance_calculator distance_calculator.cpp
```

This command tells the compiler to create an executable file named "distance_calculator" from the source code in "distance_calculator.cpp."

### 6. Run the Program:
After successful compilation, you can run the program on the console by entering:
```bash
./distance_calculator
```

### 7. Follow On-Screen Instructions:

The program will prompt you to enter coordinates for two points in the format 'x y z'.
It will then ask you to choose the distance calculation method by typing 'euclidean' or 'manhattan'.
After you provide valid input, the program will calculate and display the chosen distance between the two points.
Review the Output: The program will display the calculated distance, and you'll see the output on the screen.

### 8. Exit the Program:
After reviewing the output, you can exit the program by closing the terminal or command prompt.
