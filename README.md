Minecraft Distance Calculator example implementations as a little celebration to my [Original Distance Calculator written in Java](https://github.com/Sweet-Tooth11/minecraft-distance-calculator)

### Expect more implementations to come soon

### Why am I doing this you might ask

# Well... I honestly don't know

Mostly it's because of boredom, but also because I wanna show what I can do with some of the most popular programming languages, including but not limited to:

### C, C++, Go, Java, Javascript, Rust, Typescript and many more to follow

## Each of these Implementations will soon have their little instruction on how to run these in the first place, so keep and eye out for it ðŸ˜Š
